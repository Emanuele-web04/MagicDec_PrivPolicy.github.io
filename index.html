        MagicDec was built with privacy in mind. <br>

            (ex: "Your drawing are not stored in the cloud, but locally")
        -->
        Nothing is stored. 
        We do not track you, sell personal data or embed ad networks in the app.

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

        Since MagicDec does not collect, store, or access any user data, 
        there are no means or purposes for which we could use personal information. <br>
